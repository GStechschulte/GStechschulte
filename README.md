Hey, I'm Gabriel 👋

My interests include probabilistic programming, databases, and microeconomics.

### Repositories
- [Books with code](https://github.com/GStechschulte/books-with-code) contains code that generates the figures in books where: (1) the authors did not provide the code, or (2) it is an implementation in a different language or library. Ported code is [Bayesian Modeling and Computation](https://bayesiancomputationbook.com/welcome.html) in [Pyro](https://pyro.ai).
