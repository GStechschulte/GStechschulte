Hey, I'm Gabriel 👋

Using Bayesian methods and data engineering to solve supply chain related problems. My interests include probabilistic programming, databases, and microeconomics.

### Repositories
- [Books with code](https://github.com/GStechschulte/books-with-code) contains code that generates the figures in books where: (1) the authors did not provide the code, or (2) it is an implementation in a different language or library. Ported code is [Bayesian Modeling and Computation](https://bayesiancomputationbook.com/welcome.html) in [Pyro](https://pyro.ai).

### Contributions / Development
- [Blackjax](https://github.com/blackjax-devs/blackjax) - being useful where I can
- JAX [implementation](https://github.com/aesara-devs/aesara/pull/1360) of the Multinomial Distribution in Aesara
- [SANElib](https://github.com/SANElibDevTeam/SANElib) - a library for machine learning in SQL using Jinja templating
